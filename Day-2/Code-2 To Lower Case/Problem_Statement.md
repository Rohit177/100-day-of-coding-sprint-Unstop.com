# Intuition
# We want to take a user input string and convert it to lowercase.

# Approach
# We use the built-in lower() method to convert the input string to lowercase.

# Time complexity:
# The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

# Space complexity:
# The space complexity of this code is O(n), as we create a new lowercase string of the same length as the input.
