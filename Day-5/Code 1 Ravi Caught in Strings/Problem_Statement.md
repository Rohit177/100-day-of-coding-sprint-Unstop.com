# Intuition
The program aims to find the length of the longest palindromic substring within a given input string. It utilizes a dynamic programming approach to efficiently compute the result.

# Approach
The approach employed here involves iterating through the input string and, for each character, expanding around it to identify palindromic substrings. The program uses dynamic programming to store previously computed results, which helps in avoiding redundant calculations. By comparing characters to the left and right of each potential center, the program identifies and keeps track of the longest palindromic substring found so far.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  - The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where 'n' is the length of the input string. This is because, in the worst case, we might need to expand around each character in the string.
- Space complexity:
  - The space complexity is O(n), as we use a dynamic programming table to store results for each character position in the string. The size of the table is directly proportional to the length of the input string.
