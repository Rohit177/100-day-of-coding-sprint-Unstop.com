# Intuition
The intuition behind this code is to find the longest palindromic substring within a given string by checking for palindromes centered at each character in the string.

# Approach
The approach used in this code is to iterate through the input string character by character and check for palindromic substrings. This is done by expanding around each character, treating it as a potential center of a palindrome, and comparing characters to the left and right.

# Explaination
1. Input the desired string.
2. Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum palindrome length (initialized to 1) and the start index of the longest palindrome.
3. Iterate through the string from the second character to the second-to-last character (inclusive).
4. For each character, perform the following steps:
   a. Check for palindromes with odd lengths by expanding around the current character.
   b. Check for palindromes with even lengths by expanding around the current character and the next character.
   c. If a longer palindrome is found, update the maximum palindrome length and the start index of the longest palindrome.
5. After the iteration, extract the longest palindromic substring from the input string using the start index and the maximum palindrome length.
6. Return the length of the longest palindromic substring.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n^2)
   - The code iterates through the string, and for each character, it can potentially expand up to n/2 times to find a palindrome.
   - Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case.
- Space complexity: O(1)
   - The code uses only a few variables to store the maximum palindrome length and the start index of the longest palindrome, so the space complexity is constant.
