In this problem, we need to schedule tasks with varying difficulties over a limited number of days to minimize the maximum daily difficulty. The tasks are dependent on each other, and if a valid schedule is impossible within the given days, return -1. Otherwise, find the minimum difficulty Simon faces during completion. Dynamic programming or binary search can be used to solve this.
